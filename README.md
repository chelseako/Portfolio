# Data Science Projects Portfolio

## [Project 1: House Price Prediction Project](https://github.com/chelseako/House_Pricing_Project)
* Created a model that estimates sold prices for Honolulu houses (RMSE ~ $87,000) to help home buyers estimate a competitive bid offer.
* Custom built a web scraper using Python and Selenium for a local real estate website.
* Cleaned 700+ observations of Honolulu houses sold within the past year using Python (Pandas, Numpy) and R.
* Optimized Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Regressors to identify model with best predictive validity.


## [Project 2: FIFA 2019 Player Position Classifer](https://github.com/chelseako/FIFA_2019_Project)
* Created a linear discrimnant analysis (LDA) model that predicts player position (forward, midfielder, defender) with a cross-validated accuracy of 81%.
* Used principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis to reduce dimensionality and explore variable factoring
* Identified five factors among numeric variables (overall, defending ability, size and movement, potential, and physical ability)
